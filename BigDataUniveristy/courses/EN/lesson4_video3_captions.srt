00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,040
Here is a really short overview of the machine
learning library. The MLlib library contains

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,580
algorithms and utilities for classification,
regression, clustering, collaborative filtering

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,869
and dimensionality reduction. Essentially,
you would use this for specific machine learning

4
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:26,179
use cases that requires these algorithms.
In the lab exercise, you will use the clustering

5
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:31,140
K-Means algorithm on a set of taxi drop off
points to figure out potentially where the

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,000
best place to hail a cab would be.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,510
The GraphX is another library that sits on
top of the Spark Core. It is basically a graph

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,010
processing library which can used for social
networks and language modeling. Graph data

9
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,230
and the requirement for graph parallel systems
is becoming more common, which is why the

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,989
GraphX library was developed. Specific scenarios
would not be efficient if it is processed

11
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,339
using the data-parallel model. A need for
the graph-parallel model is introduced with

12
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:09,050
new graph-parallel systems like Giraph and
GraphLab to efficiently execute graph algorithms

13
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,840
much faster than general data-parallel systems.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,790
There are new inherent challenges that comes
with graph computations, such as constructing

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,330
the graph, modifying its structure, or expressing
computations that span several graphs. As

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,740
such, it is often necessary to move between
table and graph views depending on the objective

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,890
of the application and the business requirements.

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,390
The goal of GraphX is to optimize the process
by making it easier to view data both as a

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,290
graph and as collections, such as RDD, without
data movement or duplication.

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,740
The lab exercise goes through an example of
loading in a text file and creating a graph

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,270
from it to find attributes of the top users.

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,210
Having completed this lesson, you should be
able to understand and use the various Spark

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,410
libraries.

24
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,170
Complete lab exercise #4, creating applications
using Spark SQL, MLib, Spark Streaming, and

25
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,310
GraphX and then proceed to the next lesson
in this course.
