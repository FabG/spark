Hi, welcome to the lab setup section.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,879
In this section I'm going to tell you how
to download the lab files

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,370
that are necessary for completing the
lab exercises. Make sure you have the

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,759
VM environment loaded up

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,770
from there you open up Firefox and
navigate to the Big Data University

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,340
page

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,130
and then from there

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,970
make sure you go to the Spark Fundamentals
course. Scroll down

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,449
to where it says the hands-on lab
exercise.

10
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,190
The instructions to download and
untar the lab files

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,390
to the specified location. Again 

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,800
you are going to visit this page and then click on the download link to get

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,489
the lab files onto your hard drive into the
VM

14
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,710
Okay, I have already went ahead and
downloaded this

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,570
and it is inside my download folder. Go
to your

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:07,190
download folder and go ahead and extract this

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,150
okay

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,250
now go ahead

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,250
and copy this into the home directory

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,910
under virtuser. You are going to paste it into here.

21
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,220
Now that that completed, open up this labfiles folder 

22
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,900
make sure all the files in there. you
should have five different folders

23
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,600
There is a lab solutions folder with all the

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,640
solutions that you can use

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,940
for the lab exercises with NYC taxi

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,540
which contains a CSV file for the taxi
data in New York

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,410
and there's a subset of the file as well
and there's also one for the weather in

28
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,320
New York City

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,540
as well as some data that you can use
for the streams applications

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,160
which you will do in one of the lab
exercises and there are some changes.txt

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,440
users.txt file and a readme file
as well as a followers.txt

32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,560
Make sure you have all this set up before you start your lab exercises.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,800
You will need to use all these files.
